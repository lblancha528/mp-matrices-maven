Overview:

This project models a dynamic 2D coordinate grid. The user creates a grid of a specified
width and height, either filled with default values or a provided value.
They can then reassign the values in columns, rows, chucks of columns and rows, diagonal lines
and rectangular sections to another provided value, as well as add and remove whole columns
and rows.
After setting the grid, the user can also retrieve the value at grid position (row, column).
